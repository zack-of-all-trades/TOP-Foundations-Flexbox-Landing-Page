# TOP-Foundations-Flexbox-Landing-Page
Final project in TOP's-Foundations-Flexbox lessons

This is a blank webpage where TOP (The Odin Project) gave me a picture of what it should look like, and I had to recreate it from scratch by creating my own .html & .css. TOP only provided some of the colors and fonts.
